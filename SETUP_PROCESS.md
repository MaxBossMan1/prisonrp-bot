## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Invalid Channel ID:** Make sure you're copying the correct ID and the bot has access to that channel
2. **Invalid Role ID:** Ensure the role exists and the bot can see it
3. **Permission Errors:** The bot needs proper permissions in the configured channels

### Reset Configuration
If you need to start over, you can manually delete the `bot_config` table from the database and run `/setup` again.
