## Q&A Flow Notes
- The bot will ask each question one at a time, waiting for the user's response before moving to the next.
- For multi-part questions (like #10), the bot will ask each sub-question in sequence.
- If the user types "cancel" at any point, the application process will end.
- At the end, the bot will confirm submission and post the application to the appropriate forum with the "Unreviewed" tag.
