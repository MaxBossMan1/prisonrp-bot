## Flow Notes
- The bot will ask each question one at a time, waiting for the user's response.
- If the user types "cancel" at any point, the report process will end.
- At the end, the bot will confirm submission and create a report ticket channel for staff to review.
- Reports are typically handled privately by staff.
