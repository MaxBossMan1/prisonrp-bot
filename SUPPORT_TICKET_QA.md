## Flow Notes
- The bot will ask each question one at a time, waiting for the user's response.
- If the user types "cancel" at any point, the ticket process will end.
- At the end, the bot will confirm submission and create a support ticket channel (or forum post for ban appeals), relaying the information to staff.
